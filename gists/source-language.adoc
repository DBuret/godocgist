= Source language
:source-language: javascript

To set a default language for source  blocks, set the `source-language` attribute in the document header:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:source-language: javascript
----

Source blocks where the source language is defined behave as usual:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[source,java]
----
String foo = "bar";
----
....

renders as:

[source,java]
----
String foo = "bar";
----

If we don't give a language:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[source]
----
var foo = "bar";
----
....

it will render as JavaScript in this case, as that's what we configured as the default language:

[source]
----
var foo = "bar";
----
