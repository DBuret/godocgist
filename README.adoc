= DocGist
Anders Nawroth

DocGist is a tool that renders AsciiDoc documents fetched from public GitHub gists.
The rendering is performed using the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[asciidoctor.js] library.

== Hosted Demo

See it live at http://gist.asciidoctor.org

== Special Processing

The single addition to common AsciiDoc syntax is that links to image files will render the image and not the link, in case the link and the link text are identical.
This happens in a post-processing step after AsciiDoctor has been executed.

== Background

The original idea for and some code of this project came from here: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/graphgist -- where some additional functionality around the Cypher query language is included as well.
